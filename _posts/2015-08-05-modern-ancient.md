The summer sun followed by the summer rains.  Seeds and wees, oh so many weeds.  Broken looms and worn out brushes.  Rusty cans and cobblestone walkways.  Elephants crushing mud houses because rage (sensless murder). 

Our work:  dressed up passion and the fighting words of the post modern robot.  A direct repulsion for the mass produced yet embraced revolutionary distribution networks.  Borrow heavily when necessary from the modern world but live in the ancient. 

There are stories and then there are compulsions.  An honesty derived from mud stained finger nails and a devotion to feeling the seasons of our great earth's solar year.  Nomads at heart we play the homesteader simply to feed ourselves poison free. 

We are all slowly going the way of the buffalo but before we skip sunsets off waterfalls in the empty corner wilderness between electrons and commuter nightmares.  The ancestrial lineage pulses deep in our ground paws we can't help but sing to the moon and tweet about it moments later.  This is modern ancient.
