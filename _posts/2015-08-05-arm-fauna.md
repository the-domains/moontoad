Satao, the worlds largest elephant, moments after death equiped with nuclear tibbed ICBM to fight back, fairly, against insane desires to flaunt wealth. 

Drifting into a past reality where crows split the atom first but the worms stole the schematics and next thing you know it's spread worldwide - freely to those with there ear only slightly above ground.  Robins; naturally, are the first and soon pressurized helmets fly them high in the atmosphere.  Water holes are protected with laser beams and typewriters still used by the hominids.  Satoa is alive here once more, deploying mobile launchers to protect his parade.
